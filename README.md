# About
- Hello World! The Respondez App was named off of the popular expression "respondez s'il vous plait", or R.S.V.P. for short 
- I want to built this out of the desire for our Free Code Camp Ashburn Group so we can manage our events external from popular platforms such as Facebook or Meetup


## Features
- Log in with your Github account
- Events, attendees, and log in state persists even after refresh
- Create new events, edit, delete events
- Create and delete comments under events
- View user github description on hover over rsvp photo
- Add and remove rsvp's to different events
- View date and time comment was posted on hover

## Technologies
- Create-React-App
- Firebase for storage
- Immutability-Helper for deep state manipulation
- Github Pages for deployment 
- See package.json for other minor technologies
